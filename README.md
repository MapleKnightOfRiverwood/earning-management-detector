### Executive Summary

Financial reporting is a fundamental aspect of a company's operations, providing essential information for stakeholders,
including investors, regulators, and management. The accuracy and reliability of financial statements are critical to the
decision-making process, as they provide insights into a company's performance, financial position, and cash flows. Despite
stringent regulatory requirements and oversight, financial restatements - the revision of previously issued financial
statements due to errors, omissions, or misrepresentations - continue to occur, eroding investor confidence and potentially
leading to adverse consequences for companies.

This project presents a novel approach to predicting financial statement restatements using machine learning techniques
and a comprehensive set of financial metrics, ratios, and other indicators. By leveraging publicly available information from
the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) database, this study aims to develop a predictive model that can effectively
identify companies at risk of restating their financial statements, thus serving as an indicator of reporting quality.

The importance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the existing tools and methodologies used by stakeholders
to assess the reliability of financial statements. By predicting the likelihood of restatements, the proposed model can assist
investors in making more informed decisions, regulators in allocating resources for enforcement and oversight, and
management in identifying potential issues within their reporting processes. Moreover, the integration of machine learning
techniques in this context contributes to the growing body of literature at the intersection of finance and artificial
intelligence, showcasing the potential of advanced computational methods in addressing complex financial challenges.
